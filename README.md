## Description

This is my version of the classic Space Invaders game. The player moves the ship with the mouse and shoots with the SPACE key.
You can pause / play the game with the "P" key and alternate the sound with the "S" key.

## How To Use
In this project I used several functions of CanvasLib, a library made by my programming teacher, so to run the code, it is necessary to download the folder "libs" and the file "build.gradle.kts".
